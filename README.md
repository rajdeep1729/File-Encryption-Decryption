# File-Encryption-Decryption

This takes an file and encrypts it using an AES key and decrypts it using the same AES key.This can be used for pdf,jpg and other files.

You have to compile the two java files using javac.

For encrypting a file you should run the java executable like this:
java ImageEnc original.jpg file_name_after_encryption.jpg

For decrypting a file you should run the java executable like this:
java ImageDec file_name_after_encryption.jpg file_name_after_decryption.jpg
